##### Project1
In Java, an int typed variable can hold values in range **[-(2^31^-1), 2^31^-1]**. In order to store values out of this range, Java provides **BigInteger** class within **Math** library. The task was to design and implement **MyBigInteger** class for only positive numbers that implements the **Operations** interface. **MyBigInteger** is simply a linked list where each node stores one digit of the number, and the first node denotes least significant digit.

##### Project2
In this project, we were supposed to design and implement an arithmetic expression parser and evaluator. The program inputs an arithmetic expression from the user.

##### Project3
Given a dictionary of 200.000+words, your task is to implement a spell checker. Spell checking is a feature included in almost all text editors, such as word processors, e-mail clients, even in your mobile device’s SMS editor. A spell checker’s job can be briefly described as comparing the strings of an input text against a correctly spelled list of words, called dictionary. Then, the misspelled strings, i.e., the strings those are not in the dictionary, are reported. Furthermore, a good spell checker also suggests corrections for misspellings.

##### Project4
In this project, we were supposed to implement a graph library, which supports several operations on graph related problems. The app reads the weighted graph instances from the files attached to this text. Every file contains the number of vertices first, then list of city names, then the edges as (from, to, weight) triplets.
